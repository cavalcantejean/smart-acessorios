# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Troubleshooting Build Errors

If you encounter errors like "Cannot find module '../chunks/ssr/[turbopack]_runtime.js'" or other build-related issues, try the following steps in your development environment:

1.  **Clean the Next.js Cache and Restart:**
    *   Stop your Next.js development server.
    *   Delete the `.next` directory in your project root.
    *   Restart the development server (e.g., `npm run dev`).

2.  **Reinstall Dependencies (if cleaning the cache doesn't work):**
    *   Stop the server.
    *   Delete the `node_modules` directory.
    *   Delete the `package-lock.json` file (or `yarn.lock` if you use Yarn).
    *   Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to reinstall all dependencies.
    *   Delete the `.next` directory again for good measure.
    *   Restart the development server.

3.  **Try Running with Webpack (if Turbopack is causing issues):**
    Your `package.json` includes a script to run Next.js with Webpack:
    ```bash
    npm run dev:webpack
    ```
    If the application runs correctly with Webpack, the issue is likely specific to Turbopack in your current setup. You might need to check for known issues with your Next.js/Turbopack version combination or simplify your `next.config.js` if it has complex configurations.

4.  **Check Next.js and Turbopack Versions:**
    Ensure your `next` package and any Turbopack-related dependencies are up to date or on stable versions. Sometimes, experimental features or specific versions can have bugs.

If you are working within an environment like Firebase Studio where you might not have direct terminal access to perform all these steps, look for options provided by the Studio to "Rebuild", "Clear Cache", or "Restart Workspace" if available.
